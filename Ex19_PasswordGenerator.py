"""
Write a generatePassword() function that has a length parameter. The length
parameter is an integer of how many characters the generated password should
have. For security reasons, if length is less than 12, the function forcibly
sets it to 12 characters anyway. 
The password string returned by the function must have at least one lowercase,
one uppercase, one number, and one special character ~!@#$%^&*()_+.

Prerequisite concepts: import statements, random module, strings, string
concatenation, len(), append(), randint(), shuffle(), join()
