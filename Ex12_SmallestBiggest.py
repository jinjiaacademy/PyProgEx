"""
Write a getSmallest() function that has a numbers parameter.
The numbers parameter will be a list of integer and floating-point
number values. The function returns the smallest value in the list.
If the list is empty, the function should return None.
When you are done with this exercise, write a getBiggest() function
which returns the biggest number instead of the smallest number.

Prerequisite concepts: len(), for loops, lists, None value
