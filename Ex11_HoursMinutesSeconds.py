Write a getHoursMinutesSeconds() function that has a totalSeconds
parameter. The argument for this parameter will be the number of 
seconds to be translated into the number of hours, minutes, and
seconds. If the amount for the hours, minutes, or seconds is zero,
don't show it.

Additional challenge: break up 24 hour periods into days with a 
"d" suffix.

Prerequisite concepts: join(), append(), lists, string concatenation, 
while loops
